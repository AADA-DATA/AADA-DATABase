The AADA database is thematically organised into three MS Excel tables according to the prehistoric era: Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age periods. Each period contains both period-specific and general artefact categories and accordingly also period-specific and general variables (Table 1). The database is provided also as csv-files.

Following are the artefact categories included in the AADA database:

-Birch bark tar                                             -Iron artefacts
                                                            -Silver and golden artefacts
                                                            -Beads
                                                            -Prganic material

Each row in the table represents a single artefact, while each column represents a specific attribute, such as its type, period, site, and measurements. Pottery forms a different case as the material is not organised according to separate vessels (except pottery detailed in AADA Iron Age), but according to types/styles present in each collection main number. The detailed description of the data is found in the paper Pesonen et al. (2024).
