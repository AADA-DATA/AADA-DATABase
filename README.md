AADA DataBase:
The AADA database is thematically organised into three MS Excel tables according to the prehistoric era: Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age periods. 
Each period contains both period-specific and general artefact categories and accordingly also period-specific and general variables (Table 1). The database is provided also as csv-files.

Each row in the table represents a single artefact, while each column represents a specific attribute, such as its type, period, site, and measurements. Pottery forms a different case as the material is not organised according to separate vessels (except pottery detailed in AADA Iron Age), but according to types/styles present in each collection main number. The detailed description of the data is found in the paper Pesonen et al. (2024). 

The database also includes a collection of photographs that are found in another Zenodo repository and should be referenced as follows: Moilanen et al. 2024.
