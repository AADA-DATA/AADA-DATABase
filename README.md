AADA DataBase:
The AADA database is thematically organised into three MS Excel tables according to the prehistoric era: Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age periods. 
Each period contains both period-specific and general artefact categories and accordingly also period-specific and general variables (Table 1). The database is provided also as csv-files.
